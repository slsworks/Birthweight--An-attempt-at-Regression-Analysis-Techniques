# Birthweight--An-attempt-at-Regression-Analysis-Techniques
In this work, I worked on a dataset that includes the birthweight of new born babies. 
Using the information I learned from our course, I tried to build a predictive model on the continuous response variable (birthweight). 
This assignment encompasses feature engineering, model preparation, variable selection, and model development.
I have developed OLS, Lasso, KNN & ARD models for this dataset and chose the model that gave the least train-test score gap.
